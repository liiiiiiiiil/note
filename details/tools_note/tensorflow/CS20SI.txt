# W is a random 700 x 100 tensor
W = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([700, 10]))
U = tf.Variable(2 * W)

not so safe

# W is a random 700 x 100 tensor
W = tf.Variable(tf.truncated_normal([700, 10]))
U = tf.Variable(2 * W.intialized_value())

safer

that ensure that W is initialized before its value is used to initialize U

You sometimes see InteractiveSession instead of Session
The only difference is an InteractiveSession makes itself the default 

@
sess.run(c) is the same as c.eval()
