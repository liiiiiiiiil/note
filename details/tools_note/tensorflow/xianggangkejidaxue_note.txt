five steps

From TF graph, decide which tensors you want to log   
w2_hist = tf.summary.histogram("weights2", W2)   
cost_summ = tf.summary.scalar("cost", cost)

Merge all summaries
summary = tf.summary.merge_all()

Create writer and add graph
# Create summary writer
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter(‘./logs’)
writer.add_graph(sess.graph)

Run summary merge and add_summary
s, _ = sess.run([summary, optimizer], feed_dict=feed_dict)
writer.add_summary(s, global_step=global_step)

Launch TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir=./logs
